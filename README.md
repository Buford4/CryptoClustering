### Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

#### Key Objectives and Methods
The primary objective of this analysis was to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price fluctuations over multiple time frames using the K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data included price changes over intervals of 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

#### Optimal Cluster Count
The analysis determined the optimal number of clusters (k) through the elbow method. By evaluating inertia across k values from 1 to 11, the analysis consistently identified **four clusters** as the best structure for both the original scaled data and the PCA-reduced data.

#### Clustering Results
- **Original Data Clustering:** Cryptocurrencies were successfully clustered into four groups based on the normalized price change data. Visualization of these clusters showed clear distinctions based on short-term price changes.
- **PCA Optimization:** PCA was used to reduce the dataset to three principal components, capturing about **75%** of the variance. This reduction maintained essential information while simplifying the data structure.

#### Impact of PCA on Clustering
The PCA-based clustering confirmed the initial findings from the original data, indicating that reducing the dimensionality did not alter the underlying clustering structure. This suggests robustness in the clustering configuration identified.

#### Feature Influence Analysis
The analysis of feature weights for each principal component revealed which features most significantly influenced the clustering outcome. Notably, longer-term price changes (e.g., over 200 days) had substantial positive influence on principal components, pointing to their pivotal role in cryptocurrency behavior.

#### Visualization and Interpretation
Scatter plots were generated to visualize clusters. The plots for the original data used `price_change_percentage_24h` and `price_change_percentage_7d` as axes, while the PCA data was plotted against `PC1` and `PC2`. These visualizations provided clear insights into the grouping dynamics and confirmed the effectiveness of the clustering approach.

#### Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis not only achieved its goal of clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price changes but also demonstrated the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction with PCA in maintaining the integrity of clustering outcomes.
